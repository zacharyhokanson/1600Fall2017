	When created a variable you need to define what kind of information you will be storing. Some of the types used when defining a variable are 
	int, string, and char, for integer, strings, and charaters respecablly. Integers are numbers, characters are single characters or symbols, 
	and strings are collections of characters. For characters that aren't or can't be resresented on a keyboard there are special symbols to 
	use to define them.  */
